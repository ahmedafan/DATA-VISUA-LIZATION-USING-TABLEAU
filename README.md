# DATA-VISUA-LIZATION-USING-TABLEAU

In this project, I utilized Tableau to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data. The key objectives were to derive actionable insights and present them in an interactive and easily understandable format. Here are some highlights of the analysis:

Data Import and Preparation

Data Source: COVID-19 data was imported from Our World in Data, which included metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics.
Data Cleaning: Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and to format the data for analysis.

Analysis and Visualization

Total Vaccinations Administered: Created visualizations to show the number of vaccinations administered globally and by country, highlighting progress and coverage.
Percentage of Population Impacted: Analyzed and visualized the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19 in different countries, illustrating the pandemic's reach.
Countries with the Greatest Infection Rate: Identified countries with the highest infection rates and visualized these metrics to understand the spread and intensity of the virus.
Total Cases vs. Total Fatalities: Developed comparative visualizations to show the relationship between total confirmed cases and fatalities, providing insight into the virus's lethality.
Countries with the Highest Death Toll: Highlighted countries with the highest number of COVID-19-related deaths, focusing on the most severely impacted regions.
Global Proportion of People with COVID-19: Created a global overview showing the proportion of the population infected with COVID-19.

Interactive Dashboards

Designed interactive dashboards that allow users to:
Filter data by date, country, and other relevant metrics.
Drill down into specific regions for more detailed analysis.
View trends over time with dynamic charts and graphs.

Insights and Conclusions

Vaccination Efforts: Visualizations indicated significant progress in vaccination efforts in certain regions, while highlighting areas needing improvement.
Impact on Population: The percentage of the population impacted by COVID-19 varied significantly between countries, reflecting differing pandemic responses and healthcare infrastructure.
Infection and Mortality Rates: Identified patterns in infection and mortality rates that provided deeper understanding of the virus's impact and informed public health strategies.
By leveraging Tableau, the project effectively transformed complex COVID-19 data into clear, actionable insights through compelling visualizations, facilitating better understanding and decision-making for stakeholders.
